# Netflix-Recommendation-System
netflix recommendation system
Data Collection: 
We will gather a dataset containing information about Netflix titles and user preferences. Our dataset consists of 8807 raw tuples with 12 unique features, which will serve as the basis for our recommendation system.
Feature Engineering: 
We will analyze the dataset and create new features that may be helpful in predicting user preferences. This could include extracting additional information from text fields or combining existing features to create more meaningful representations.
Hyperparameters and Training Configurations:
For each recommendation model (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, or hybrid approaches), we will experiment with different hyperparameters and training configurations. Some common hyperparameters include:
Learning rate: This is the step size thatâ€™s used in the gradient-based optimization algorithms.
Batch size: The number of samples used in each iteration of the training process.
Number of epochs: The number of times the entire dataset is passed through the model during training.


Regularization parameters: 
Parameters that control the complexity of the model and help prevent overfitting.
We will evaluate the performance of our recommendation models using metrics such as cosine similarity scores, which measure the similarity between users or items based on their features. High cosine similarity scores indicate that the model is accurately predicting user preferences and providing relevant recommendations.
